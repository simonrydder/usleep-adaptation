Expects one EEG and one EOG channel as input.
The model has depth 10 and complexity factor 0.5 resulting in ~240K weights

Trained, validated and tested on the 'BIG SLEEP' dataset (v2) from ERDA:

1. 886 gradient steps per epoch
2. 10^-4 starting learning rate
3. LR scheduler with factor 0.5 after 20 epochs of no improvement
4. Early stopping after 40 epochs with no improvement.
5. Trained only on the 13 training datasets, tested on the hold-out datasets
6. Obtained ~0.8 kappa on training sets and ~0.7 kappa on hold-out

Expects a single EEG channel as input.

Created by Jesper.
Trained in the following way using the 'BIG SLEEP' dataset:

1. Pre-trained in the regular fashion using randomly chosen derivations.
2. Finetuned using m1-m2 derivations from all recordings that have that available.
3. Finetuned one EESM19 after that. This is from 'split 0'
